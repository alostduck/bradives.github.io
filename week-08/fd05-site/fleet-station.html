					<h2>About Station 51</h2>

					<p>
						Station 51 is our only station, it houses Engine 51, Engine 51-A
						(adam, or backup), Tender-51, and the two aid units, Aid 51 and
						Aid 51-A (adam or backup). Additionally, units can be parked
						outside the station and are rotated out on a seasonal basis, these
						units are the Brush engines, Brush 51 and Brush 52 (the off road
						and back up brush engine) The utility (Utility 51) as well as the
						pick up, utility 51-A(adam), however this unit also doubles as a
						command unit, typically for one of the deputy chiefs. The command
						units (Chief 51, Battalion 51 and Deputy Chief 51) are kept with
						those officers so they may respond from anywhere.

					<h2>What goes on at station 51?</h2>
					<h3>Staffing</h3>
					<p>
						On a typical day, Station 51 is staffed by a combined staff of
						full time, part time and volunteer staffing. Our shifts are 12
						hours long, however some of our part-time and volunteer staff
						combines those shifts into 24 hour days During the day, staffing
						is 1 full-time officer/firefighter/EMT, 1 full-time
						firefighter/EMT and 1-3 part-time or volunteer firefight/EMTs
						overseen by a duty chief. At night the station is staffed by 3-5
						part-time firefighter/EMTs overseen by a designated duty chief.
					</p>
					<h3>Daily activity</h3>
					<p>
						On a daily basis, crews perform readiness checks on the units and
						equipment, have a daily workout and perform public outreach,
						education. Crews also complete training and drills.
					</p>
					<h3>Is the station staffed at night?</h3>
					<p>
						Yes it is! Due to our station's age and ordinal construction
						design, crews are unable to sleep within the actual station. This
						is being corrected with our new station, scheduled to begin
						construction in 2020.
					</p>
					<p>
						While at night, the station may appear to be unmanned, the crews
						are indeed available to respond to calls, starting in 2018, the
						department was able to secure a sleeping residence for crews just
						behind the station, on Main street, next to city call. This
						greatly improved our night time responses.
					</p>
					<h3>New Station update</h3>
					<p>
						The department is going ahead with the new station 51, to be
						located at our current administration, located at 33019 Cascade
						View Dr, Sultan, WA 98294. The funding phase is now over (Thank
						you for your votes!) and the plans are being finalized, we hope to
						break ground and begin construction early in 2020.
