					<h2>About Aid 51</h2>
					<p>
						Aid 51 is a Braun ambulance mounted on a Ford E350 van chasse.
						This is our first out aid unit and is used for nearly all of our
						aid calls. The vehicle is typically staffed with 2
						firefighter/EMTs but sometimes one of our probationary
						firefighters will be riding along as a 3rd crew member for
						training and evaluation as part of their progression as new EMTs.
						80% of our 911 dispatches are medical calls so this vehicle is
						defiantly our busiest vehicle.
					</p>
					<h2>Equipment and Functions</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							medical equipment for evaluation and care
						</li>
						<li>
							Self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and hand tools for
							crew to use in firefighting operations, as this unit can also
							respond to fires as needed.
						</li>

						<li>
							Equipment to move people such as a stair-chair with tracks on
							it and foldable  seats and tarps to move patients
							in.
						</li>
						
					</ul>
