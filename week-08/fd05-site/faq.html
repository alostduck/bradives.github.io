									Why does the Station appear un-staffed at night?
								</dt>
								<dd>
									It is staffed, however our night shift is in the
									building behind the station since our current station
									does not have sleeping quarters. Crews are still
									alerted to calls. However since we are not inside the
									station at night, if you are coming to us, you will
									need to call 9-1-1 and tell them where you are. The
									best practice is to go to the front door of the
									station and wait for us there.
