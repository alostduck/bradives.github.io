								Any one of our qualified firefighter/EMTs can check your blood pressure. 
								Feel free to stop by the station during normal business hours.  It's free and you don't
								need a pre-existing condition. In fact, checking your
								blood pressure may be an early warning against developing
								dangerous health conditions. Come see us!
