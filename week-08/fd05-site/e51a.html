					<h2>The second out engine</h2>
					<p>
						Engine 51 adam is a 2002 HME pumper class engine. It carries much
						of the same tools and equipment that Engine 51 carries. It is used
						as a second out engine as well as a reserve/back up incase Engine
						51 needs to be taken out of service for any reason such as repairs
						or maintenance.
					</p>
					<h2>Some differences between E51 and E51-A</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							E51-A carries 1000 gallons of water
						</li>
						<li>
							E51-A has an electronic pump panel that is located on the front
							of the engine compared to E-51, where the pump panel is
							located on the drivers side with a half electronic, half
							mechanical pump panel.
						</li>
						<li>
							Slightly different layout for tools and hoses and hose
							connections.
						</li>
