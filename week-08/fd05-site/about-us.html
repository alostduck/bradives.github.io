					History and Leadership</h2>

					<h2>History of the Department</h2>
					<p>
						The department was founded in 1911 and was an all volunteer
						department until the late 1990s when the department recognized the
						need for full time staffing and hired it's first two career
						members. In the early 2000's the department hired several more
						full time firefighters from within the volunteer ranks. The most
						recent full time firefighter being hired in 2019, we now employ 3
						full time firefighters, 20-30 part-time and volunteer
						firefighters, 2 full time officers, 1 full time Deputy Chief, 1
						part time Deputy Chief and 1 full time Chief.
					</p>
					<p>
						The station was originally located right off U.S. highway 2 at 5th
						street in what is today the city's post office. In 1973, The
						current station was built at 304 Alder ave. At the time,
						volunteers simply responded from home when alerted to a call and
						came to the station for drills. As the city grew, the department
						realized the need for around the clock staffing, beginning to use
						volunteer and then part time staff at night, an initially staffing
						of 2 firefighter/EMTs, some years later 3 firefighter/EMTs and
						since 2016 staffing has been 4-5 part-time/volunteer
						firefighter/EMTs at night and 2-3 Full Time firefighter/EMTs and
						1-3 part time/volunteer firefighter/EMTs during the day. crews
						work 12 hour shifts or more. Staff that lives in district can
						respond from home as needed also.
					</p>
					<h2>1938 Howe Engine</h2>
					<p>
						As of June 1937, the City of Sultan authorized the purchase of a
						new fire engine, which would be delivered in 1938. The 1938 Howe
						Northern Centrifugal pumper which was built on a Chevrolet chassis,
						came completely equipped with a hose bed, 500 gpm pump, 150 gallon
						booster tank, two CO-2 fire extinguishers, and 1000 feet of 2.5
						diameter inch hose. Something that was unique to this specific
						engine was the heavy aluminum cab top, which had not been fitted
						to that model of vehicle before and this vehicle was one of the
						first in the nation to have it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, the Howe is still kept running by the Sultan volunteer
						firefighters association, and is used annually in the shindig
						parade, typically held in the first week of July.
					</p>
					<h2>Model T apparatus</h2>
					<p>
						Also maintained by The Sultan Firefighters Association is the 1911
						Model T, which did not feature a pump but did carry a hose bed.
						The Model T is also used annually in the Shindig parade.
