					<h2>About Utility 51</h2>
					<p>
						Utility 51 is a 4x4 chevy ambulance converted to be a light rescue
						unit. This unit is almost exclusively with and by our swift water
						rescue team. It contains tools for rope systems and rescue as well
						as equipment needed for water rescue operations such as floating
						rope, buoys, water proof bags for our radios and a stokes basket
						for hauling patients via rope system or if the person needs to be
						carried a long distance (for example down a hiking trail) the
						basket has a large wheel that can be attached to the bottom. This
						unit can also double as an aid unit if needed, and has been used
						in snowy conditions due to its ability to be used as a 4x4.
