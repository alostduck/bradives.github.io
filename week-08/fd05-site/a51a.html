					<h2>About Aid 51 Adam</h2>
					<p>
						Much like Engine 51 Adam is the back up to Engine 51, Aid 51 Adam
						is the backup to Aid 51. However, this unit does see a bit more
						action, so it is more like our second out Aid unit, meaning if Aid
						51 is already on a call and there is a crew available, this unit
						will respond in place of a mutial aid unit coming from Monroe or
						Gold Bar. The inventory is nearly identical to A-51 with some
						slight differences such as equipment brands.
					</p>
					<h2>Equipment and Functions</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							medical equipment for evaluation and care
						</li>
						<li>
							Self containted breathing apparatus (SCBA) and hand tools for
							crew to use in firefighting operations, as this unit can also
							respond to fires as needed.
						</li>

						<li>
							Equipment to move people such as a stair-chair with tracks on
							it and foldable carryiable seats and tarps to move patients
							in.
						</li>
