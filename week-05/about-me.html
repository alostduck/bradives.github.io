                per minute while requiring a force of 75 PSI. Typically it is operated in defensive fire conditions and placed on the ground. In this case, the contents of a larger building were on fire and this was the mist direct way to save it. It

            <h2>Connor the Firefighter</h2>
            <p>
                My oldest boy and middle child, Connor is featured in this picture doing one of his most favorate things in the world, driving daddy's fire truck.
            </p>

            <p>He is sitting in the engineers seat of Engine 51 adam (E-51A), the back-up pumper of <a href="http://www.snofire5.org" title="Homepage of Sultan Fire Department">Sultan Fire Department</a> which is one of two fire departments that I work at
                part time.</p>
            <p>
                I chose this picture for a couple reasons, foremost being the fact that the boy a handsome little guy. Look at him!! Cute little fella. Also shows a bit of my life and since this is an about me page that makes sense. I'm a father and a firefighter and
                here is my boy and one of the fire engines I work off of.
            </p>

            <p>E51-A is an older truck, a 2002 HME western states pumper, carrying 1000 gallons of water onboard as well as a 30 gallon foam tank. It has an eletronic pump panel that isn't without it's ghosts. It's not uncommon for it to randomly devlop
                a fault or have a valve get stuck open. Which is why I prefer the manual action pump panel of our first out engine, E-51. A much newer panel, it still has automatic functions but the valves are controlled by levers instead of switches.</p>

            <p>Connor is a younger boy, a 2017 2 year old (at the time of this writing) little guy with a hearty laugh and a happy personality. he does not carry any water onboard but can have a few "external ounces of fluid" if a diaper change is needed.
                He runs off waffles, "chick nuggests" and "bu-nanas". It is not uncommon to see connor laughing, however he is known for his cuddles as well. Connor loves fire trucks but is always asking to go see daddies fire truck, which is where you
                see him here.</p>

                    I grew up on the north side of Kirkland, WA Kirkland is a city in King County, Washington, United States. A suburb east of Seattle, its population was 89,557 in a 2018 census estimate,[4] which made it the sixth largest city in the county and the thirteenth
                    largest in the state. The city's downtown waterfront has restaurants, art galleries, a performing arts center, public parks, beaches, and a collection of public art, primarily bronze sculptures. Kirkland was the original home of the
                    Seattle Seahawks; the NFL team's headquarters and training facility were located at the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point) along Lake Washington for their first ten seasons (1976â€“85), then at nearby Northwest University
                    through 2007.[7] Warehouse chain Costco previously had its headquarters in Kirkland. While Costco is now headquartered in Issaquah, the city is the namesake of its "Kirkland Signature" store brand.
