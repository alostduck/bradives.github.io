              <h2>What is an internet domain name?</h2>
              <p>
                    A domain name is defined as a “a human-readable address for any web server available on the Internet” <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name"><i>Mozilla Devlopers "what is a domain name?"</i></a></cite> 
                    and also is “a unique name of an organization or person on the Internet” <cite><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/45215/internet-domain-name"><i>pcmag.com encyclopedia: internet domain name</i></a></cite>.  
                    Computers connected to the internet are addressed using public IP (IPv4) addresses which are written as a set of 4 numbers separated by dots.  Each set of numbers ranges from 0 to 255.  
                    For IPv6, it’s even more complex, “written as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers, separated by colons”.
                    <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name"><i>Mozilla Devlopers "what is a domain name?"</i></a></cite> 
                    These numbers are for the computers to find and they handle it easily.   Humans, on the other hand, have a hard time remembering long complex numbers.  (seriously, try recalling a phone number you haven’t looked at in a while.) 
                    So, we assign unique names to the IP address for easier navigation

              <h2>Why are domian names so important on the web?</h2>
              <p>
                    Domain names are important to identify “Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services,
                    with a text-based label that is easier to memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols” 
                    <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><i>wikipedia-domain name</i></a></cite>.  And without them the Internet would not be effective.   
                    Cats.com is much easier to remember and find than a series of numbers like 123. 123. 0.1.   
                    And if the website in question is a business, 
                    placing their brand name inside their own domain name makes them much easier for their customers or consumers to find.

              <h2>Why do domain names have to be unique?</h2>
              <p>
                    A domain name is a more than just a name, it also a brand.   
                    Companies put their names into their domain name so they easy for consumers to find 
                    and also so they do not get lost in the shuffle.   Also, a unique domain name separates the business or company from competitors.  
                    “many e-commerce companies primarily use their domain name as their company name, service mark and trademark”

              <h2>What does it mean to register a domain name?</h2>
              <p>
                    Registering a domain name is the only way to start using a domain name.   
                    Simply put, it’s the process of getting a domain name that identifies IP addresses with a rememberable 
                    name that can be used in URL’s to identify web pages. <cite><a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/domain_registration.html"><i>webopedia.com "domain registration"</i></a> </cite> 
                    Since you cannot “buy” a domain name, instead you buy a year (or longer) right to the domain name from a domain name registrar.   
                    A domain name registrar is an ICANN or national ccTLD accredited company who has the authority to register domain names.

              <h2>If you wanted a domain name that is already taken, how could you get it?</h2>
              <p>
                    If the desired domain name is taken, options are limited.   
                    If the domain name must absolutely be had, a WHOIS lookup can be used to find the contact information of the original owner 
                    and see if they are willing to part with the domain name and sell it.  
                    According to an article from iwantmyname.com, <cite><a href="https://iwantmyname.com/blog/what-to-do-if-the-domain-name-you-want-is-taken"><i>iwantmyname.com "what to do if the domain name you want is taken"</i></a></cite>
                    occasionally your desired domain name may already be in use by a legitimate purchaser.  However, it may also have been bought by 
                    a “domain squatter” or someone who simply buys the domain name gambling that the name may be desired by a person or business and that 
                    said person/business will pay for the domain name to avoid legal fees and risk of being denied the rights to use the domain name.  
                    Alternatively, if the domain name is that necessary, legal action is an expensive option.  
                    Assuming the original owner does not wish to sell it and it has not expired. 
                    Other options include settling for changing or shortening the domain name slightly.   
                    Or trying a different top-level domain other than .com.  (There are a variety of top-level domains.  
                     According to domains.google.com, options include .org, .coffee (perfect), .academy…etc.) 
                     The risk with this choice is possibly having name confusion.    
                     People trying to find your site might keep entering “yoursite.com” instead of “yoursite.org”.

              <h2>Getting your own domain name</h2>
              <p>
                  Getting your own domain name involves three important things:
                  <ol>
                      <li>choosing a registrar</li>
                      <li>Knowing what you want to pay and how much you'll have to pay</li>
                      <li>checking WHOis to find if your desired domain name is already taken.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>alternativly:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>being flexable with your choice of domain name</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3> Registrar company and pricing options I looked up</h3>
                  <ul>
<li>Cloudflare: personal websites are free.</li>
<li>domain.com: $7.49 per year for .com $9.74 for .org</li>
<li>Godaddy.com: prices are per month, $3.99 for economy, $4.99 for deluxe, $8.99 for ultimate.  
GoDaddy seems to have a lot of catches to their pricing including the previously mentioned prices not being applicable unless 
two years are paid for upfront.</li>  
<li>hover: seems very privacy oriented and pricing is $12.99 for one year.</li> 
<li>Namecheap: 14.99 a month but does give options to be able to make an offer to current owner of a domain name if yours is taken.</li>
<li>Google Domains: $12 a month, does not support all domain extensions, does offer WHOis privacy as long as your site is registered with google domains.</li>
</ul>

              <h2>My domain name choices and availabilty:</h2>
              <p>
                    For a personal website my first choice would be bradives.com.   However according to <a href="https://whois.net/">WHOis.net</a>, that domain name is currently owned until 2021.   
                    Bradleyives.com is available.   So for a personal website, that would be my choice. It's simple and relates directly to me.
