                    A replacement website project for fire department with old, antiquated website.
                </h2>
                <p>The site proposed is a replacement for a rural fire department currently in serch of 
                    a replacement for their antiquated and neglected webiste.  
                    The title will be "small town FD's webiste"
                     <!--the basis of this project is my current employer whos website is indeed terrible 
                        and not representitve of the current staff or equipment.-->

                    The site purpose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site's purpose will be a propsed replacement or upgrade from a rural deparment's current 
                    neglected and out of date website.  The main purpose of the fire deparment's website is to 
                    provide information about current events and operations as well as education for the residents the 
                    department serves and the general public.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Topics covered on the site will include fire safety information, information about department units 
                    and equipment, programs and training offered as well as any news the department has released about events 
                    that are ongoing.

                <h2>
                    Comparable sites
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These three sites all contain parts of what I believe the site needs to have:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.snohomishfire.org/" title="Home of Snohomish fire district #4">Snohomish Fire District #4</a></li>
                    <p>Snohomish (whom i also work for) has recently redone their webpage.  it has several things I like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the background features the people working there and gives the firefighters and medics a good image</li>
                            <li>status of burn bans is right on the home page, easy information to find</li>
                            <li>nav is a bit long but does have commonly searched for information</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <li><a href="https://www.lvfc.com/" title="Lutherville Volunteer Fire Company">Lutherville Volunteer Fire Company</a></li>
                    <p>Found this from a simple google search.   The front page is the exact kind of page that
                        nerdy firefighters look for.   You might have never considered firefighting in your life and 
                        the front page makes you want to work there.   In fact, there is a recruitment element on the 
                        front page that is very prominent.  other things I like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>page is clearly geared towords perspective recruits and the public they work for</li>
                            <li>current events feed with recent news</li>
                            <li>each of their vehicles has it's own page. nice.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p> 
                    <li><a href="https://www.lafd.org/" title="LAFD home page">LAFD home page</a></li>
                    <p>
                        A lot of big city fire departments have webpages but LAFD seems to have a super detailed one covering
                        literally everything they do, emergency response related or not.   There's even a page about their
                        movie set unit!  (Imagine that job.) Other cool stuff:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the whole site is super public information oriented.  Any and literally all questions
                                you may have about the LAFD have answers here.   Even the FAQ has a link for "I'm not sure who
                                to contact".
                            </li>
                            <li>Like Lutherville, the front page features a currrent events feed but also a live feed 
                                to their social media, which is a big thing these days as well.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>  
                </ul>

                <h2>Main content</h2>
                <p>
                    Stuff I want to include on the site:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A recrtuing ad.  The department is rural and relies heavily on volunteers and part time staff and 
                            because of this departemnts experince and training, the part-time and volunteer staff are constantly
                            being hired away to full time jobs in larger departments.  This might need to be included in the recruitment.
                        </li>
                        <li>Current events and news, a feed of some kind.  The city has a facebook page where citizens are constatly 
                            asking "what are these sirens about?" and "where can i get info about the Fire station hosting a birthday party?"
                            This could be their one stop shop.
                        </li>
                        <li>Current events and news, perhaps live social media windows or views (twitter or facebook)</li>
                        <li>Nav.  Want to keep this simple yet informatative.  Home, about, public education, CPR/First aid calsses and perhaps a sign-up.  Contact info at least.</li>
                        <li>Pictures of memebers in action, pictures of the vehicles.  Familiarity is a comfort thing, citizens and also Firefighting buffs (see: nerds) can also enjoy looking at and learning about the vehicles and equipment</li>
                        <li>perhaps a live scanner to listen to radio traffic?  (unsure of the legal side of this though.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    The personality of this site will be inviting, assittive and have a humble yet prideful feel to it.  
                    The idea is that the visitor feels welcome and that prosepctive employees want to work there by viewing the site.

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    Being located in a rural area, some parts of the population most likely expereince lower speeds in their internet 
                    connection.  The site might be constructed for a mobile first design for less data being sent, hopefully leading to faster loading.
