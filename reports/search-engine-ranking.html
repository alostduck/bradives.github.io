          <dt>How does a search engine work?</dt>
          <dd>
              <p>A search engine works in 3 stages, crawling, index and rank.   
              The first step, crawling, is done prior to a search happening and works as a 
              process of discovery using robots.  (also known as spiders…shudders) These 
              robots discover content by following links.   The way it works is the crawl-bots 
              discover a URL and then crawl through the site following it’s navigation and then 
              following links to other pages and branching out from there to find yet more sites 
              in an exponential process.  </p>
               <p> The links create a path and these results are stored in the search engine index 
                using algorithms (these are a collection of formulas and processes that determine 
                how the information is stored.    
                The search engine index is a database containing all the discovered content 
                that is deemed by the crawlers to be search worthy.   This content is then ranked 
                according to a number of factors, including the content of the site itself, links 
                leading to the site (this is kind of like word of mouth or referrals) as well as 
                the internal navigation of the site.   </p> <cite><a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo/how-search-engines-operate">moz.com <i>how search engines operate</i></a></cite>

          <dt>
            Why do different search-engines give different ranking to websites
            for the same search phrase?
          </dt>
          <dd>Depending on the search engine, different priorities are placed on elements 
              of what the page contains.  For example, Google is very text driven with it’s rankings.  
              Versus Bing, which may place more of a priority on images representing the search term.  
               They also deal with keywords, differently, either by direct matches or by context, meaning 
               the content behind the keyword.  Meta keywords are also used with the exception of google, 
               who has stated they will not use them.  On top of this, backlinks, or links from other 
               websites to the one being indexed, are dealt with differently.  Google 
               (the most used search engine by far which is why it keeps ending up being my example) 
               values the quantity of the back link, meaning how reputable the site is that provided it.  
                (basically how good is the referral) Other search engines such as Bing use both quality of
                 back links and also quantity, so the more backlinks the higher  the ranking.

          <dt>What is a &lt;meta /&gt; tag?</dt>
          <dd>Meta is described as data (information) about data.   
              (according to w3schools.com) Meta is snippits of content
               within the page used to alert search engines.   The meta tags 
               are like flags to the search engine as to what the page is about.   
                Keyword meta tags are exactly as they sound, keywords placed in 
                the meta that are used to attract search engines. The idea with keyword meta tags is that they
                should be able to be read and give a general idea of what the site is about
                Due to over-use of keyword meta tags, Google no longer uses them as a part of its 
                 ranking algorithm because marketers found they could “over-stuff” 
                 their site with meta keywords of whatever was trending.   
                Description meta tags are much more useful because they are used to 
                explain what the site is about or describe it briefly, in fact it cant be too long because search engines only 
                read them and only do so briefly.  Description meta tags are a summary of the site.
                These are also visible to the searcher through the search results which could lure traffic
                  based on the description.   <cite>

                </dd>
          <dt>What is the purpose for Keyword and Description meta tags?</dt>
          <dd>The main purpose is to get the page they are being used on raked higher in the search
              engine results.
          </dd>
          <dt>Why might you include meta tags in your pages?</dt>
          <dd>A description tag in my page would help the person reading their search results to know that my site 
              is the link they are looking for.  A seach for similar terms or shortened (for example googling "town fire" instead of "town fire department")
              will have different results and while the site may be included in the results of the search, the 
              description tag as well as a keyword of "town" or "town fire" and/or "town fire department" will help the 
              user recognize the desired link.  
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Do meta tags make your pages more easily searchable or improve its
            ranking?
          </dt>
          <dd>While meta tags improve the users search experienece and get "clicks", (click through rates is a term I've come 
              across, meaning people who click on the site), according to Google, they do not actually impact search engine rankings. 
              so they make the site more easily searchable but do not improve it's ranking.

            What are several ways that you can publicize your personal website
            project and make it more visible on the web?
          </dt>
          <dd>Ways to publicize my personal website include:
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          <em>Search engine optimization</em>-This is done by using keywords and phrases through the site 
                          as well as meta tags and alt text to images.  Content should be meaningful and not repeatitive.   
                          other things that can be done include image optimization, use header tags and even submit a site map to google.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          <em>social media marketing</em>-While marketing a fire deparmtent may sound like an odd idea,
                          the world runs through social media these days.  The deparmtment does have a social media platform 
                          and may be starting another soon.  The site will be linked through those.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          <em>Content</em>- If there is one thing I have taken away from this research (there is a ton more than that)
                          It's that content is the best way to grab attention.  But there are a couple of things to avoid. Low quality 
                          content and repeatitive content will actually get the site ranked lower so that's to be avoided.   Non accessable
                          content and poorly coded sites also get pushed down the search rankings.  So, quality content is a big part of it.
