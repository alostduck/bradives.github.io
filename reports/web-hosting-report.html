					<h2>What is a web server and why would you need one?</h2>
					<p>
              A web server can refer to two entities, either on the hardware side, the software side or both.  
               On the hardware side a web server is a computer that holds the web server software and the actual physical web page components.  
              The hardware is a computer specifically built to be a web server and host webpages.  
               A common misconception is that web server computers are high powered super computers.   
               These servers are connected to the internet and handle physical data exchange with other physical devices.
              The software is also a simple application that sends the web-page to the web-client requesting it.  
              Servers use HTTP’s that understands URL’s and HTTP.  Content is accessed through the requested domain name 
              and then sent to the requesting device being used to browse the content.

					<h2>Explain why getting a domain name is not enough to put your site up on the web.</h2>
					<p>
                    While a domain name gives your site it’s unique name, 
                    web servers give you a place to store the physical files 
                    and be accessible to the internet from a computer that is 
                    always available to the internet.  Basically, the domain is the name, 
                    the web server is the storage and dispatch system.

					<h2>What service does a web hosting company provide?</h2>
					<p>
                        Web hosting companies provide the web servers which store the websites.  
                        They also provide the physical environment that the web servers require, 
                        including a cooled environment and repairs and housekeeping as required. 
                         They also provide the technical knowhow to do these things to reduce downtime
                          of web sites. ”A web hosting company provides the web server 
                          and internet connectivity that allows your website to be 
                          available to anyone connected to the internet.”

							<cite>
								<a href="https://www.johnnyflash.com/choosing-a-web-host/" title="johnnyflash.com">
									<i>johnnyflash.com</i>
								</a> the top issue is reliability, 
                            simply having the site stay online and not go down.  The article also lists speed and bandwidth, 
                            how fast can the visitors get to the site and basically how wide is the portal through 
                            which the data travels to them.  The smaller the bandwidth, the slower things become.  
                            Picture traffic piling up on the highway.   
                            A two-lane highway with a lot of fast cars is going to be backed up like Seattle 
                            traffic during…any moment in time, vs an 8-lane highway with lots of space for all those cars.   
                            The wider the band with the more and larger files can go through it. Also listed is support,
                             because when you need help, it should be there and pricing that isn’t going to be changed or 
                             added to constantly.  In other words, standard pricing.

							<h2>. On average, what is the price range (price per month) for hosting a website?</h2>
							<p>
                            The price range, for a smaller site that will be using shared hosting, 
                            which is the lowest level of service for small sites that expect a low level 
                            of traffic, is roughly $2 to $15 a month.  This varies by provider and also 
                            by options added to a plan.

							<h2>What are the most important features for you when reviewing a hosting plan?</h2>
							<p>
                            I feel that there seems to be a couple very important features that are needed 
                            in a hosting plan.  First would be speed and space and security.  Not running
                             out of room for my files and having my site visitors avoid experiencing a slow 
                             webpage are important.  And having a site become cancerous due to malware or
                              getting hacked is just plain terrible.  
                    </p>
							<p>
                            Just as important would be uptime.   If the server goes down and the site goes 
                            with it, then that’s time for the site to either not be helpful to those seeking
                             information or a loss of consumers and protentional customers.  Which might be
                              the main reason for the entire website.  
                    </p>
							<p>
                            Also support.   If there is an issue or a problem or a question, 
                            the site hosting company needs to be available. </p>
							<p>  
                            Finally, pricing.  While it would be lovely to get all of this for free, 
                            you get what you pay for.   Realizing that, I would want to see all this 
                            and other features (tech, free apps etc.) and find them at the fairest 
                            pricing per month.  
                            
                    </p>

							<p>*Unmetered means that they don't limit these items.  hostgator.com says that using 25% or 
                            more of system resources for longer than 90 seconds will be in violation of their terms of service.</p>

							<h2>Identify one of the companies and hosting plans as the best value for the price.</h2>
							<p>
                        To me, the value seems to be in hostgator although all of these options seem similar.  Hostgator has the best overall price 
                        per month and while I'm wary of not having a defined limit of speed or size, their explanation
                        states that most customers with smaller sites never have a problem with the limitation.  That being said, not having 
                        a limit on resources within range seems useful.
