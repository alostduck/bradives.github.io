          <h2>What is a web server and why would you need one?</h2>
          <p>
              A web server can refer to two entities, either on the hardware side, the software side or both.  
               On the hardware side a web server is a computer that holds the web server software and the actual physical web page components.  
              The hardware is a computer specifically built to be a web server and host webpages.  
               A common misconception is that web server computers are high powered super computers.   
               These servers are connected to the internet and handle physical data exchange with other physical devices.
              The software is also a simple application that sends the web-page to the web-client requesting it.  
              Servers use HTTP’s that understands URL’s and HTTP.  Content is accessed through the requested domain name 
              and then sent to the requesting device being used to browse the content.
