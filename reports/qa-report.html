          <dt>What does quality assurance mean for website development?</dt>
          <dd>
                <p>Quality assurance is crucial to ensuring website usability, functionality, and performance. 
                    Basically, it is a testing process to make sure everything is working as it should.  This works in three phases: </p>
                <ul>
                        <li>requirement testing, which is the process of confirming that a the list of requirements expressed by the 
                            client is present in the prototype or alpha version of the site.  These requirements are then used to 
                            evaluate the prototype or layout of the site.   This is important to make sure all design goals have been met.</li>
                        <li>Design testing, which is the process of the tester looking at the overall design of the site and making sure
                             it conforms to the original design plans on both desktop and mobile versions.  </li>
                        <li> finally, functionality testing.  This is literally clicking every single button, every single link, function 
                            and process the site does.  Essentially the tester is trying to break the site, even testing it across multiple 
                            browsers. </li>
                        </ul>
                <p> To website development, QA is hugely important because first impressions last and if the website does not 
                    work well (or at all), does not look good or does not meet the requirements of the client then visitors to the site 
                    will likely not come back after their first time.</p>

                2.	Describe the two key principles of Quality Assurance: "Fit for Purpose" and "Right First Time."
          </dt>
          <dd>
                <p>The simplest definition of “fit for purpose” and “right first time” I could find is:</p>
                <dl>
                <dt> Fit for purpose:</dt>
                <dd>The product should be suitable for the intended purpose.   For websites this means meeting 
                    the client’s needs and that the site has the requirements needed.</dd>
                <dt>Right first time:</dt>
                <dd>mistakes should be eliminated.   The idea is simply that mistakes are dealt with before the site 
                    is presented to the world.  A site filled with mistakes is going to drive visitors away.</dd></dl>
                <p>with regards to web development, these concepts are critical.</p>
                
                </dd>
          <dt>How do web standards relate to web quality?</dt>
          <dd>
                <p>quoting Wikipedia: “When a web site or web page is described as complying with web standards, 
                    it usually means that the site or page has valid HTML, CSS and Java Script.” 
                    <cite><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards#The_web_standards_movement#Common_useage><i>wikipedia: 
                        web standards</i></a></cite> Which is basically saying that if all the HTML, CSS and Java Script has to meet 
                        Web Standards by being validated through the W3C validator.  It makes sense, then, that website quality would 
                        increase with compliance to standards.   According to <cite><a href=https://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/Web-Quality>w3.org, 
                            <i>web quality</i>,</a></cite> conforming to web standards will not restrict creativity, will increase quality 
                            and not restrict the level of entertainment or excitement of a website.   Also, conforming to standards will 
                            decrease costs due to needing less versions per web browser.  The pages will have less of a dependency on 
                            unneeded technology and have longer life.   </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>4.	Describe what Web Accessibility means. What steps you can take to make your pages more accessible?</dt>
          <dd>
                <p> The simple definition of web accessibility is making the web useable for people with disabilities.  
                    However, a more detailed explanation of this concept is that 9-11% of web traffic is people with disabilities.  
                    But that’s more than just physical, mental or cogitative disabilities. Other disabilities include conditional 
                    or situational disabilities.</p>
                <p> Web Accessibility then, is a necessary part of the planning, design and creation of a website.   
                    Not only does increasing accessibility cater to those that are unable to experience the web without some sort of 
                    assistive technology, but all that visit the site, because the site is now accessible to everyone, making it much 
                    easier to use.    In my experiences throughout life, your average human being prefers easier to use over unnecessary 
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p> An interesting idea that I discovered is that web accessibility does not just include making the site more usable for 
                    people with physical or mental disabilities but also situations for people who are</p>
                <ul>
                <li>are using smaller or slower devices or devices with a different input mode to view the internet</li>
                <li>people whose abilities have been changing due to age</li>
                <li>Situational limitations such as being in situations that prevent the viewer of the site from using their 
                    device properly or fully.  They may be unable to have the volume up on their device or the light is too bright.  
                    (like direct sunlight) Another situation might be poor internet connection.   </li>
                </ul>
                <p> To make sites more accessibility friendly, the steps are simple.   Really it’s building the good habit of 
                    coding the site and including the accessibility elements and techniques by habit so they are included in the 
                    code by default.   These elements include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>using alt tags in photos.   This is for screen readers.  The alt tag describes the photo included so a good 
                    practice is to be as descriptive as possible in the alt tag.</li>
                <li>Some users cannot use a mouse or mouse pad and need a keyboard to get around.   The simplest and easiest way to 
                    help with this is to leave navigation buttons to their defaults, be careful with animations involving buttons or 
                    links (perhaps leave them out) And generally make the site keyboard friendly.</li>
                <li>closed captions for media for those that either are hearing disabled or in a situation that they cannot use sound.</li>
                <li> use colors that contrast well but are also color blind user friendly.   Viewers wont use the site if they 
                    cannot read it.</li>
                <li>use of ARIA tags such as “role” to assist with the navigation of the site</li>
                <li> using a title tag in order to provide a short description of the pages content</li>
                </ul>
